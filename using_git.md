# Why use git and github?

"Git is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files – called a repository – in a sane, highly structured way. If you have no idea what I’m talking about, think of it as the *Track Changes* features from Microsoft Word on steroids." - Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester, [**Happy Git with R**](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html)
